    <h1>The Oak Tree</h1>
    <h2>This is  a poem about the oak tree in the Archbishop Ryan courtyard</h2>
    
<p>In the courtyard an oak tree stands so <strong>tall</strong> <br>
Its branches spread, a <em>shelter</em> for us all <br>
Through seasons change, it's strong and true, <br>

Its leaves a dance of green in the <em> morning dew</em>. <br>
Its roots delve deep taking in Earth's embrace <br>
A symbol of<strong> endurance</strong>, time, and space.<br>
With whispered thoughts of birds and squirrels told,<br>
This oak tree's bark rash and bold <br>

Beneath it's shade I find a tranquil grace <br>
The courtyard oak tree a sacred place
